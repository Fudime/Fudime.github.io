## **Summary of Content**

### **Adapting Cartographic Practices**
Ravina emphasizes the need to align cartographic practices with historical contexts, cautioning against the anachronistic use of modern territorial concepts for pre-modern settings.

### **Beyond Traditional Maps**
Traditional maps, especially choropleth maps that use shading or coloring to denote political boundaries, fail to represent Tokugawa Japan accurately. These maps impose modern, Western notions of sovereignty and fixed borders onto a fragmented, fluid historical reality.

### **Computational Cartography and Voronoi Polygons**
To address these issues, Ravina leverages computational tools:
- Represents villages as points instead of polygons, reflecting Tokugawa views of political space.
- Utilizes Voronoi polygons to depict fragmented and overlapping political authority, providing a more accurate visual of power distribution.

### **Spatial Contiguity and Power Dynamics**
Using **logit analysis**, Ravina finds that spatial contiguity significantly influenced daimyo power:
- Contiguous territories enabled trade monopolies and streamlined taxation.
- Challenges narratives that prioritize rank or resources over geographic control.

### **Implications for Historical Cartography**
Historians must rethink mapping conventions for pre-modern systems. Modern methods can distort historical realities, but computational tools offer nuanced representations that illuminate complexities like those in Tokugawa Japan.

## **My Reading Note**
Ravina critiques modern cartographic conventions and offers computational alternatives that paradoxically better reconstruct historical contexts. These methods expand the historian’s toolkit by combining close reading with innovative solutions, underscoring the importance of critically applying computational approaches in the humanities. As early modern East Asian studies develop unique tools, this evolution promises exciting advancements for the field.

## **Difficult Concepts**

### **1. Choropleth Maps**
- **Origin**: Geography and cartography.  
- **Purpose**: Use shading or colors to represent data across fixed regions.  
- **Applications**: Population density, GDP mapping, disease spread visualization.  
- **Critique**: Assumes rigid boundaries, unsuitable for Tokugawa Japan's fluid political boundaries.

### **2. Polygons and Points in Cartography**
- **Origin**: GIS (Geographic Information Science).  
- **Purpose**:
  - **Points**: Represent specific locations (e.g., villages).  
  - **Polygons**: Represent areas (e.g., territories).  
- **Ravina’s Approach**: Uses points to reflect Tokugawa focus on population centers, avoiding the rigidity of polygons.

### **3. Voronoi Polygons**
- **Origin**: Mathematics and computer science.  
- **Purpose**: Divide space into regions closest to specific points.  
- **Applications**: Service area planning, species range analysis.  
- **Use in Ravina’s Study**: Models fragmented, overlapping zones of influence.

### **4. Logit Analysis**
- **Origin**: Statistics and social sciences.  
- **Purpose**: Predict binary outcomes and analyze influencing factors.  
- **Applications**: Consumer behavior, medical recovery prediction.  
- **Use in Ravina’s Study**: Evaluates how spatial contiguity impacted daimyo governance.

### **5. Spatial Contiguity**
- **Origin**: Geography and regional studies.  
- **Purpose**: Measures the physical connectedness of areas.  
- **Applications**: Urban planning, habitat connectivity.  
- **Use in Ravina’s Study**: Highlights governance efficiency in contiguous versus fragmented territories.
